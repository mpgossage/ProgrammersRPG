# ProgrammersRPG
Source code of programmers rpg game on kongregate

# Description
This is the source code for an assignment I did when learning Unity, which I subsiquently published to Kongregate.
It was written in Unity 4.5 (I think), but I have done a quick port to Unity 5.6 to get it working with webgl (as nothing supports the Unity plugin anymore)

There might be some interesting code in here (the quests system I was proud of), but the main reason this was put on github
was to allow me to port the code easily.

# Compiling
This game WILL NOT COMPILE from the repo.

The Programmers RPG includes certain paid assets from the asset store.
These have (obviously) not been included in the repo.

They are:
\Assets\Models\Blade_girl	Blade Girl NPC	https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/5095
\Assets\Models\Blade_warrior	Blade Warrior NPC	https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/6515


It also has a few free assets which are included
\Assets\Models\golem	Maze Element Ice Golem 	https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/3746

And a bunch of the Unity default assets.

Therefore, its not playable unless you buy and add in the assets, or rework it use other assets.
